# InsaneArch
The Insane CPU is a processor that is based on [BrainFuck](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck). The main difference is that there are for instences of the interrupter that are interweved. This means that we are able to do more then normal BrainFuck.

For exampe the you could load the text

```Hello World!```

in to the second program memory and then load

```{.>}```

into the program tape it would print out the clasic Hello World. For those who aren't familiar with BrainFuck the normal example Hello World program look like this 

```++++++++[>++++[>++>+++>+++>+<<<<-]>+>+>->>+[<]<-]>>.>---.+++++++..+++.>>.<-.<.+++.------.--------.>>+.>++.```

you can see the difference.
